#Link Board Lab

We are going to create a clone of [hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com/). Hacker news is a reddit-style link board that allows users to post links which are upvoted by other users so the best links rise to the top.

For today we're going focus on `Users` and `Posts` only. The goal for tonight is to create an app that allows users to sign up, login, and add posts (no comments or voting yet).


##Models

####User
* email
* password_digest
* name

####Post
* title
* link
* user_id


##Routes

| POST | /signup | users#create | create user in database (signup) | 
| GET | /login | sessions#new | render user log in form |
| POST | /login | sessions#create | create user session (login) |
| GET / DELETE | /logout | sessions#destroy | destroy user session (logout) |
